                <p>Hi there! My name is Jenya Pribylov. I’m a Business Systems Analyst with a strong technical foundation in full-stack development, data migration, and system optimization. My expertise lies in analyzing business processes, gathering and documenting requirements, and translating complex needs into clear, actionable technical specifications that developers can deliver against. I specialize in producing detailed operating procedures, test cases, and system documentation that support both technical teams and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring alignment and smooth adoption.

I’ve delivered results across multiple industries — from improving data governance and reporting at Statistics Canada, to leading technical web development at Algonquin College, to modernizing national systems at CUPW. In my current work, I drive process improvements, design data models, lead regression and UAT testing, and collaborate closely with developers to resolve defects in critical areas like dues, finance, membership, and grievance tracking.

This portfolio highlights the impact of my work as an analyst: creating clarity where requirements are ambiguous, strengthening systems through rigorous testing and documentation, and enabling organizations to operate with greater efficiency, accuracy, and confidence.</p>
